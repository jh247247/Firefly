* Setup
  I should have some bash script in here to set things up
  automatically for you at some point.

  Basic steps are:
  - Install python 3
  - Install mosquitto so that we can actually talk to the nodes
  - Install Flask for python using pip
  - Make some sort of database that python can hook into
  - Make this scripty stuff run on startup.
  - ???
  - Profit!
